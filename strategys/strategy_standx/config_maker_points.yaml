# StandX Maker Points Strategy Configuration
# Optimized for maximum points with minimum fill risk

exchange:
  exchange_name: standx
  chain: bsc

symbol: BTC-USD

maker_points:
  # Target distance from mark price (in basis points)
  # 0-10 bps = 100% points, 10-30 bps = 50% points, 30-100 bps = 10% points
  #
  # Strategy: Place at center of band (5 bps) for maximum buffer
  # - Order can drift 5 bps in either direction before needing rebalance
  # - Trade-off: slightly higher fill risk than 9 bps
  target_bps: 5 # Place at center of 0-10 bps band for max buffer

  # Order sizing
  leverage: 40 # Leverage multiplier (1x = no leverage, 2x = 2x leverage, etc.)
  # With 1x leverage, use percentage of balance for single side
  balance_percent: 85 # Use 90% of available balance

  # Rebalancing
  rebalance_interval: 1 # Check every 1 seconds (less frequent = less API calls)

  # Band monitoring - when to rebalance
  min_bps: 0.1 # Rebalance if order gets too close to mark (fill risk)
  max_bps: 9.9 # Rebalance if order drifts too far (before losing 100% tier)

  # Risk management
  auto_close_position: true # Immediately close any filled positions

  # Order side: "buy", "sell", or "both"
  # With 1x leverage, can only do one side at a time
  # Set to "buy" or "sell" based on your market view
  order_side: buy # Start with buy side only
